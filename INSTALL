Installation Instructions for the Packet Debugger (pdb)

NOTE: You MUST install the PCS (Packet Construction Set) package
before installing this package.  PCS is available on Source Forge at:

http://pcs.sf.net

as well as in FreeBSD and Mac ports.

The Packet Debugger follows the normal Python conventions for building
and installing and there is very little, if any, magic.  To install
the program and the associated packet classes into your system do:

> python setup.py install <return>

To test your installation do:

> cd tests/ <return>
> pdb.py -f test.out
pdb> list
... Some amusing output.

To build the documentation you will need pdflatex and a BSD version of
make(1) installed.  Go into the docs directory and build the
documentation:

> cd docs/ <return>
> bsdmake all

you will see PDF versions of the docs.
